Switch quickly between pages, posts, or any other custom post types.

== Description ==
This plugin adds a select box to the post editor that allows you to quickly switch to another post of the same type without leaving the edit posts screen.
It works with post, page and custom post types and is aware of what type of post you're currently editing.
For example if you're editing a page it will list pages, if you're editing a WooCommerce product it will list all of the other WooCommerce products.

The dropdown menu will show up above the title of the edited content (WP > 3.7+).
For WordPress between 3.5-3.7 the dropdown will after the permalink and
for WordPress older than 3.5 the dropdown will appear after the editor.
